### Work & Academic Projects

**[FinDataSync: Advanced Financial Data Optimization in Google Sheets-Python](https://github.com/nicolasramirezperilla/FinDataSync/tree/master)**  
In this project, I worked with financial statements, balances, and other accounting data in Google Sheets. The main challenge was dealing with disorganized formats, merged cells, and complex structures, which complicated code conversion. I used Python techniques to automate balance updates, reconstruct parameters, and generate new information from the initial data. Results included complete automation of the update process, allowing for more efficient and accurate financial data management.

**[Quantum DataWorks: Automation and Optimization of Data Processes in Excel-Python](https://github.com/nicolasramirezperilla/Quantum_DataWorks/tree/master)**  
In **Quantum DataWorks**, I managed operational data such as tariff positions, products, brands, FOB and CIF values, and details about countries and quantities. I implemented data mining and cleaning techniques in Excel, developing scripts to identify patterns and classify information. Automating data analysis, the generated reports significantly reduced operational time and costs, facilitating comparison and consolidation of information.

**[DataWave: Digital Transformation and Data Process Automation with SAP HANA](https://github.com/nicolasramirezperilla/DataWave-Project/tree/master)**  
In the **DataWave project**, I led the digital transformation of data management processes for 12 internal departments at Colsubsidio. The challenge was to replace manual tasks in Excel and Access with automated Python-based solutions, seamlessly integrating them with SAP HANA. I developed custom scripts for data parametrization, integration, and preparation for SAP Analytics Cloud. The project resulted in a 50% reduction in processing time, enhanced data accuracy, and a streamlined workflow that significantly improved the efficiency of data handling across the organization.

**ElectroCensus: Interactive Dashboard Development and EV Population Analysis in Power BI**
The **ElectroCensus** project focused on visualizing electric vehicle (EV) population data, including EV adoption rates, geographic distribution, and vehicle types. I optimized charts and metrics to enhance data visualization and implemented interactivity based on EV type, region, manufacturer, and adoption trends. I addressed challenges related to data consistency and integration to ensure accurate insights. The resulting dashboard provided a comprehensive understanding of the EV market, supporting data-driven decisions for policymakers and industry stakeholders.

### What I've Learned

Through my work and academic projects, I have gained valuable skills and knowledge in:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Faced significant challenges using AI to identify patterns in large datasets, leading me to develop automation code. For example, in a recent project, I used machine learning techniques to detect hidden patterns in disorganized financial data, optimizing how I processed and analyzed data. This approach helped automate data cleaning and preparation, improving the efficiency and accuracy of my analyses.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** I have extensively worked with Python, Jupyter, Excel, SQL, and Power BI for data cleaning and preprocessing. I found Python particularly useful for data manipulation and process automation. Jupyter has been invaluable for documenting and executing my analyses, while SQL has enabled efficient handling of large data volumes. Excel and Power BI have been essential for visualizing and presenting data clearly.

- **Process Automation:** I have developed and applied automation solutions to improve efficiency in data management and analysis. This includes creating Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as updating financial balances and generating reports. These automations have significantly reduced the time required to complete these tasks and minimized human errors.

- **Query Performance Optimization:** I have implemented advanced techniques to optimize query performance in databases. This has included creating efficient indexes and restructuring SQL queries to improve speed and efficiency in data retrieval. These efforts have resulted in a significant reduction in response times and improved handling of large data volumes.

- **Effective Data Visualization:** I have used various visualization techniques to enhance the clarity of my analyses. A particularly effective technique I implemented was creating interactive scatter plots in Power BI to analyze the relationship between key variables. This visualization allowed users to explore data more intuitively and gain detailed insights from large datasets.

### What's Next?

My journey as a data analyst is constantly evolving. I am excited to continue learning and applying my skills to more challenging and real-world projects. In particular, I am interested in delving deeper into financial and industrial data analysis. I look forward to exploring projects that involve optimizing financial processes and improving efficiency in industrial sectors, using advanced data analysis and visualization techniques to address complex problems and generate effective solutions.
